# PCA-with-SVM
PCA with SVM on sckikit breast cancer data
I learned Principal Component Analysis while taking Optimization and Risk Management in my master's degree. 
In further studies and projects in Python, I learned to use PCA in Python, visualize it in a heatmap, and then feed that into the machine learning support vector machine
The SVM performed very well. The project I had done in SVM previously I needed to adjust the parameters.
This is a project I had to do on my own.
